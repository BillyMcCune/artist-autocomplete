Verse 1:
Lost in the rhythm of the night
Stars align in perfect light
Every moment feels so right
When you're dancing by my side

Chorus:
Hold me close, don't let me go
Our hearts beat to the tempo
This feeling I've come to know
Is everything I need to grow

Verse 2:
Morning sun breaks through the haze
Memories of better days
In your eyes, I see the ways
That love can set my soul ablaze

Chorus:
Hold me close, don't let me go
Our hearts beat to the tempo
This feeling I've come to know
Is everything I need to grow

Bridge:
Time stands still when we're together
A love like this could last forever
No storm could break our tether
We'll face the world, whatever

Chorus:
Hold me close, don't let me go
Our hearts beat to the tempo
This feeling I've come to know
Is everything I need to grow

Outro:
Stars align in perfect light
When you're dancing by my side
