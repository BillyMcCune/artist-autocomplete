Verse 1:
The thunder of the drums shakes me to the core
Breaking down the walls I've built before
Guitars screaming out what I can't say
Finding strength to face another day

Chorus:
Rise up! Against the tide
Rise up! No place to hide
Rise up! With fists held high
This is our battle cry

Verse 2:
Streets are lined with broken dreams
Nothing's ever quite the way it seems
But we stand together through the storm
Revolution ready to be born

Chorus:
Rise up! Against the tide
Rise up! No place to hide
Rise up! With fists held high
This is our battle cry

Bridge:
When the world has turned its back on you
Remember what we've fought to prove
That even in the darkest night
We'll never give up the fight

Solo:
[Guitar Solo]

Chorus:
Rise up! Against the tide
Rise up! No place to hide
Rise up! With fists held high
This is our battle cry

Outro:
This is our battle cry
This is our battle cry
